# XboxControllerKeyboard
Allows the use of a wired xbox360 controller for keyboard input.

## Notice
- Generally, taking control of the controller's interface requires admin priviledges so `cargo build` then run your executable with admin priviledges
- If you are using a different gamepad or even a slightly different xbox controller the output profile will probably be different but you can try changing XBOX_CONTROLLER_ID to the ID of your gamepad
